    <h2>About Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks
      associated <br> with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web
      applications that run online<br>on a browser. It may, however, also include
      web design, web programming, and database<br>management. Web development is
      closely related to the job of designing the features and<br>functionality of
      apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for<br>the actual
      construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
