        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup
        language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web
        page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the
        browser how to display the content.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
        HTML and JavaScript.

        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
        programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
        well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
        environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
        Acrobat

        Node. js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment
        for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side
        programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for
        client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional
        language.
